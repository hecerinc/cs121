Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets. Using set notation, give formal descriptions of the following sets:

\subproblem The set of all nonempty subsets of $X$.

\subproblem The difference between $X$ and $Y$, i.e. the set containing all elements of $X$ that are not elements of $Y$. (This is denoted $X \setminus Y$.)

Let $\mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, 2, ... \}$ be the set of natural numbers. For each of the following functions $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, state whether $f$ is (i) one-to-one/injective, (ii) onto/surjective, and/or (iii) bijective.

\subproblem $f(x) = x!$

\subproblem $f(x) = \begin{cases} 
      x + 1 & \text{ if } x \text{ is even } \\
      x - 1 & \text{ if } x \text{ is odd } \\
   \end{cases}$

Consider the binary relation $\lesssim$ defined by $A \lesssim B$ if there exists a one-to-one (injective) function $f : A \to B$. Is $\lesssim$ reflexive? symmetric? transitive? Briefly justify your answers. Explain in simple terms what it means if $A \lesssim B$ and $B \lesssim A$.

Define the Fibonacci numbers as follows:
\[ F_0 = 0 \]
\[ F_1 = 1 \]
\[F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \text{ for all } n > 1\]
Prove the following statement by induction:

\subproblem For $n > 1$, $F_n$ equals the number of strings of length $n-2$ over alphabet $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$ that do not contain two consecutive $a$'s.

Let $L_1$ be the language $\{ a^n : n \ge 0\}$ and $L_2$ be the language $\{x : x \in \{a, b\}^* \text{ and } |x| = 5\}$. Answer yes or no to the following questions.
\subproblem Do the following sets contain the empty string $\vareps$?
\begin{enumerate}
\item $L_1 \cap L_2$
\item $L_1 \cup L_2$
\end{enumerate}

\subproblem Do the following sets have the empty set $\emptyset$ as a subset?
\begin{enumerate}
\item $L_2$
\item $L_1 \cap L_2$
\end{enumerate}

\subproblem Do the following sets contain $\emptyset$ as an element?
\begin{enumerate}
\item $L_1$
\item $P(L_2)$

\textit{Note: On every problem set we will provide a challenge problem, generally significantly more dif- ficult than the other problems in the set, but worth only a few points. It is recommended that you attempt these problems, but only after completing the rest of the assignment.} \\\\
Show that in any group of at least six people, either three of them are mutual friends (i.e. they all know each other) or three of them are mutual strangers (i.e., none of them know each other). You may assume that knowing is symmetric.
